# Privy

**Privy** is a secure, open-source messaging app focused on privacy, end-to-end encryption, and local-only message storage.  
Messages are ephemeral by design, and no content is ever stored on the server.

> Built for private, confidential, and sensitive communication â€” with full user control.
